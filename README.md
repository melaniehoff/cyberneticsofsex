What can cybernetics, the study of communications and control systems, teach us about the ways we shape and are shaped by sex?

Thid class explores how cybernetic social regulatory systems in technological platforms produce social pressure and govern behavior. In a dynamic and discussion based environment, we delve into systems of sexual reproduction & regulation, the history of technology and eugenics, and the political importance of sex work. Through discussing examples from art, contemporary media, and hands on exercises, we will tease out social patterns and norms that emerge over time, through bodies, to form culture.
