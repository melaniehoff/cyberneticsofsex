# Cybernetics of Sex:
## Technology, Feminisms, & the Choreography of Culture
An introduction to cybernetics as the study of the ways we shape and are shaped by systems of feedback and control. Through the example of sexual reproduction and the ways sex become gender, we will look at social regulatory systems in the technological frameworks in which we are embedded and in the social pressures that govern our behavior. We will tease out social patterns and norms that emerge over time, through bodies, and come together to create culture.
