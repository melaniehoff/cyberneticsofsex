What can cybernetics, the study of communications and automatic control systems, teach us about the ways we shape and are shaped by sex?

By delving into topics like sexual reproduction and the ways sex become gender, we will explore how social regulatory systems in technological platforms produce social pressure and govern behavior. Through discussing examples from art, contemporary media, and hands on exercises, we will tease out social patterns and norms that emerge over time, through bodies, to form culture.
