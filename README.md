# Cybernetics of Sex:
## Technology, Feminisms, & the Choreography of Culture
An introduction to cybernetics as a framework for understanding the ways we shape and are shaped by systems of feedback and control. Through the example of sexual reproduction and the ways sex become gender, we will look at social regulatory systems in the technological platforms and processes in which we are embedded and in the social pressures that govern our behavior. Through art historical and contempory examples, we will tease out social patterns and norms that emerge over time, through bodies, and come together to form culture.
